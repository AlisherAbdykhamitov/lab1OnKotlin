    <string name="step1">Find the right technique.</string>
    <string name="step2text">Yoga provides a variety of techniques. It has techniques for the body and the mind. It is important that you practice each yoga exercise so that it works well for you. If something hurts you, omit it. If it works well for you, keep doing it. You can vary all yoga exercises creatively––you must ask yourself constantly: “What do I need now? What’s good for me? What triggers my tension the most?” </string>
